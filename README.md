# TypeScript Exercise

## Before you start

ðŸ‘‰ First, fork and clone this repository.

ðŸ‘‰ Then run this command:

```
npm install
```

## Introduction

This repository contains two applications: a `server` and a `client`.

## Server

The `server` application is written using TypeScript, and is located in the `/server` folder.

ðŸ‘‰ Have a look at the code in `/server/src/main.ts`. This is the starting point for the server.

The server is a very basic Node Express application. Express is a webserver which "listens" for requests and sends a response, depending on the URL of the request and any data sent along with it.

Don't worry if you're not familiar with Express yet - that's not the point of this exercise! Feel free to take some time to explore the rest of the code in `/server` to see if you can figure out what it's doing.

If you start the server using `npm run start-server` you will see the console output. When it finishes starting up, it shows a couple of example URLs you can use to interact with it. By default, these are:

`http://localhost:8080/`

and

`http://localhost:8080/api/posts/all`

ðŸ‘‰ Start the server with `npm run start-server` and visit these URLs using your browser. (Or call them using a command line application such as `curl`, or a GUI such as `Postman`. Anything that makes HTTP requests can speak to the webserver.)

You should be able to see:

`http://localhost:8080/` - This should show a successful health check message.

`http://localhost:8080/api/posts/all` - This should show a list of blog posts in JSON format.

ðŸ‘‰ Verify that the URL endpoints above are working correctly.

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to take the `client` code and convert it to TypeScript.

Usually a `client` for an app like this would be a web frontend, perhaps built in a framework such as React.

But any app that makes HTTP requests can talk to a webserver, and in this case our `client` is another Node application which runs in the console.

ðŸ‘‰ If the server is still running, stop it by pressing `Ctrl-C` in the terminal.

ðŸ‘‰ Run the client ONLY by running the command `npm run start-client`

ðŸ‘‰ Explore the client application in the console.

## Your Goal

ðŸ‘‰ Convert the client application to TypeScript.

ðŸ‘‰ Since TypeScript is already configured for this project, you just need to rename files to `.ts` and start using the TypeScript features.

ðŸ’¡ It's up to you what to do. Perhaps you can rely on a lot of type inference, perhaps you want to define many custom types.

ðŸ’¡ ??? Since types are already defined for the `server` you can reuse them. However, it's not normally this simple to ...

ðŸ‘‰ Be creative if you like! Feel free to modify / improve the `server` and `client` applications if you can see ways they could be improved. The point is to learn, not to arrive at a predefined perfect solution!
